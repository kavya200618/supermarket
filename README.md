## Objective
The objective of this task is to create a basic interactive dashboard that visualizes sales performance by product, region, and month using Power BI or Tableau.

---

## Tools Used
- Power BI (preferred) or Tableau
- Optional: Python + Pandas (for data cleaning)
- Dataset: Superstore_Sales.csv

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:
- Order Date
- Region
- Category
- Sales
- Profit

---

## Dashboard Components
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
- Line Chart: Sales over Months (Order Date converted to Month-Year format)
- Bar Chart: Sales by Region
- Donut Chart: Sales by Category
- Slicer/Filter: Category-based filtering

Color coding was used to highlight top-performing regions and categories.

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Converted Order Date to Month-Year format
- Verified data types and removed any null or duplicate values
- Ensured clean numerical formatting for Sales and Profit

---

## Key Insights
1. The West region had the highest total sales in Q3, especially in the Office Supplies category.
2. The Furniture category had the lowest sales overall but showed an upward trend in December.
3. The Central region maintained consistent growth across months.
4. The Technology category generated the highest profits across all regions.

## Interview Questions and Sample Answers

### What does a dashboard do?
A dashboard provides a visual and interactive summary of data to help stakeholders make informed decisions quickly.

### How do you choose the right chart?
The choice depends on the data:
- Use line charts for trends over time
- Use bar charts for comparisons between categories
- Use pie or donut charts for showing part-to-whole relationships

### What is a slicer/filter?
A slicer or filter allows users to interactively filter the data by a chosen dimension such as Region or Category.

### Why do we use KPIs?
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) help track critical business metrics and guide performance evaluation.

### What did your dashboard show about sales?
It showed regional and category-wise performance trends, monthly sales progression, and highlighted peak and low-performing segments.

### How do you make a dashboard look clean?
By limiting the number of visuals, using consistent color schemes, organizing layout logically, and labeling all elements clearly.

### Did you clean the data before starting?
Yes, the dataset was cleaned to remove nulls, duplicates, and ensure proper formatting for dates and numerical fields.
